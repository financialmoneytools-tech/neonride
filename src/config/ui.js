 * NEON RIDE - on screen text and the title card.

 * The one place in the project where non-ASCII is allowed, and the only place:
 * everything the PLAYER reads is Turkish, everything a developer reads - code,
 * comments, commit messages, console logs - is English ASCII. Keeping the
 * player facing strings together is what makes that rule checkable rather than
 * a thing people remember.
